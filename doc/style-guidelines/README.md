Toontown Infinite Style Guidelines
==================================
Code and documentation in the master and release branches of Toontown Infinite must conform to these guidelines. Any code submitted in a pull request that is not properly formated will be rejected, as it is best to keep a readable, and consistent style for future contributors to read, and understand your code. However, don't blindly follow these guidelines into unreadable code. Sometimes it is best to use your own better judgement.
