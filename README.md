Toontown Infinite
=================
Toontown Infinite is a free, non-profit game inspired by Disney's closed game - _Toontown Online_.

### Batch Shortcuts ###
Toontown Infinite provides a set of batch shortcuts. To use these, you must first ensure that `PPYTHON_PATH` contains the correct path to `ppython.exe` from Toontown Infinite's custom Panda 3D build. By default, this path is set to: `C:/Panda3D-1.9.0/python/ppython.exe`.

If a batch shortcut prompts you for a response, you may enter nothing if you wish to use the default settings.

### Shell Shortcuts ###
For Linux users, Toontown Infinite also provides a set of shell shortcuts. To use these, you must first ensure that `PPYTHON_PATH` contains the correct path to `python2.7`. Typically, this should be: `/usr/bin/python2.7`.

If a shell shortcut prompts you for a response, you may enter nothing if you wish to use the default settings.

### Contributing ###
Don't just start contributing. We talk about what we are about to do before we do it!
